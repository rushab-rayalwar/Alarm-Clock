# Alarm-Clock
Interactive Alarm Clock In Javascript

I have made an alarm clock using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT as a part of a skill test for my full stack web development bootcamp. I have tried to make the interface to look visually pleasing. Separate sceerns appear for adding an alarm and when an alarm is hit. A list of added alarms is displayed on the main screen (the list is empty by default). An alarm can be deleted from the list by clicking the cross icon towards the right in the list. Please make sure to be connected to the internet while exploring the project to ensure all the imported icons appear as expected.
